# Final Project MyDay

Most of us have some kind of social media ”app” where we spend time, like Facebook or Instagram and they are often perceived as being superficial.

There is seldom or maybe more closer to the truth, never any space for honest reflections and we believe that it's essential for our wellbeing to reflect on a daily basis.

So we created a web application that offers a space for (inner) reflection.
We call it My Day and it is our version of a digital journal.

## The vision

Front-end in React 
Back-end in Node.js
MongoDB database
Navigation using React Router
Should work in Chrome, Firefox & Safari.
Be responsive and work well on mobile, tablet and phone.
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
