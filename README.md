# Final Project MyDay

Most of us have some kind of social media ”app” where we spend time, like Facebook or Instagram and they are often perceived as being superficial.

There is seldom or maybe more closer to the truth, never any space for honest reflections and we believe that it's essential for our wellbeing to reflect on a daily basis.

So we created a web application that offers a space for (inner) reflection.
We call it My Day and it is our version of a digital journal.

## Tools and techniques

We used these tools and techniques:
- Front-end in React 
- Back-end in Node.js
- MongoDB database
- Navigation using React Router
- Should work in Chrome & Safari
- It is responsive and works on mobile, tablet and phone

The challenge we had was to combine the saved message with data to an exicting picture fetched from an external API. Initially we could see the data in the database but it wasn't visable in the frontend. When we managed to combine these two techniques, we could both save and post the data together with the picture. 

## The vision
If we had more time

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
